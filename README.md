    + When considering injuries, tornados are a significant health hazard with a recorded 21,765 injuries and 1545 fatalities between 1995-2011.

* Economic damage:

    + Floods cause the greatest economic consequences when considering property damage and crop damage.  Totalling in $149 billion USD in property and crop damage from 1995-2011.
